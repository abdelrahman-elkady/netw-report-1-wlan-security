Wireless networks are introduced to overcome the mobility and space problems that occurs in classic
wired networks.\cite{wifi_what_next} As devices are increasingly in need to communicate in a mobile
environment, WiFi (IEEE 802.11) is introduced to deliver a wireless connected network, and it showed a
success in both private personal and business oriented networks.\cite{gast_2005} Introducing mobility
comes with challenges like limited range and security enforcement.\cite{gast_2005} In this report, the
security concerns, registration and authentication, encryption and exploits in WiFi will be discussed.
